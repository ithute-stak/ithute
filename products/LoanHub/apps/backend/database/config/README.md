# Config

Typed application configuration loaded from environment variables.

## Location

```text
apps/backend/database/config
```

## Engineering rules

- Keep tenant and branch access checks on the backend.
- Do not commit secrets, generated caches or runtime uploads.
- Keep user-facing labels readable; database UUIDs are internal identifiers.
- Add or update tests and documentation when behaviour changes.
- Run the project validation workflow before deployment.
